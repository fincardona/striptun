<h1>Bandwidth test for polarimeter STRIP56</h1>

This document contains a preliminary analysis of the frequency response of the STRIP polarimeter STRIP56.

The report has been generated on 2017-12-12 using striptun v0.1 (commit `9ec992948c3f28beaba799f7b4149cab6e4bf9ff`). 

We measured th bandpasses for each detector of the polarimeter.
In particular, we used a signal generator to inject a signal at frequencies in the range 38-50 GHz (steps of 0.1 GHz) into the receiver and measure the output signal as a function of frequency.
